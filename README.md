# FIT2099 Assignment (Semester 1, 2023)
## Project Description: 
### Elden Ring Rougelike

We were given a rudimentary engine (Package: edu.monash.fit2099) and we were asked to create a rougelike version of the hit game "Elden Ring". Over the course of the project, with heavy inspiration from the game, we were instructed to design and implement a set of requirements. Towards the end of the project we were also asked to brainstorm, design and implement an additional creative requirement.

Since FIT2099 is an Object-Oriented design unit, we were marked on our ability to uphold OO principles such as SOLID and DRY to ensure that, should the project expand into a real game, we could continue to maintain it for years to come.

Please note that the engine was created by the FIT2099 teaching team.
